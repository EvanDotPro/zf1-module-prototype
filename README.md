This project is my attempt to perfect self-contained "add-ons" for Zend
Framework that are individually capable of adding or modifying any functionality
to an application.

For example, an add-on can:

*    Provide module(s) with controllers/actions/views/models/mappers/forms/services
*    Add additional libraries to the include path
*    Define additional bootstrap resources
*    Provide an authentication system
*    Probide database connections
*    Depend on other add-ons
*    Be a theme (simply provide additionall css/images or overwrite phtml's of other add-ons)
*    Expose web service API's
*    Anything else...
